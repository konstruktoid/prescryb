# Access Control and SSRF

Read this when the change touches authorization, permissions, or a server-side request
to a destination the user can influence.

## Server-side authorization

- Enforce authorization server-side, through decorators or middleware (Flask-Security,
  Django Guardian, DRF permissions). Never rely on the client, or on the UI hiding
  something, as the only control.
- Check authorization against the object being acted on, not only the endpoint. An
  endpoint-level check that omits an ownership test is the standard insecure-direct-
  object-reference bug.
- Apply least privilege to database roles and file permissions. `S103` flags overly
  permissive `chmod` literals, not database grants.

## Server-side request forgery

Before making a server-side HTTP request to a URL or host derived from user input
(webhooks, callback URLs, "fetch this link" features):

- Validate the destination against an allowlist.
- Block requests to internal, link-local, and loopback address ranges.
- Resolve and check the address that will actually be connected to, and disable or bound
  redirect following, so a permitted hostname cannot redirect into the internal network.

No `S`-rule catches SSRF. OWASP folds it into Broken Access Control (A01:2025).

## Fail closed

A security check must fail closed. A broad `except:` or `except Exception:` around an
authorization or cryptographic check can silently turn a failure into an allow. `BLE`
and `TRY` keep handling narrow once you have decided to handle something, but do not
tell you that this particular failure must deny.

This maps to OWASP's Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions category (A10:2025): a caught
exception that lets control flow continue past a failed check is as dangerous as an
uncaught one.

## Assertions

Never use a bare `assert` to enforce a security invariant (`S101` flags `assert` usage
in general). Assertions are stripped when Python runs with `-O`, so a security check must
never depend on them executing.

## Debug and error surfaces

- Ensure debug modes are off in production configuration (for example Django
  `DEBUG = False`).
- Ensure stack traces, environment details, and internal paths are never returned in
  responses. Confirm this post-deploy if the repository has a way to check.
- This is OWASP's Security Misconfiguration category (A02:2025).

## Concurrency

Watch for TOCTOU races on shared resources, for example temp file creation. `S108` flags
predictable temp paths, not the race itself. The same applies to deadlocks and race
conditions around anything guarding a security-relevant resource.
