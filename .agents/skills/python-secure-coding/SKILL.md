description: Authors and modifies Python source code with security best practices that static analysis alone does not fully cover, including input handling, deserialization, secrets, subprocess/SQL/crypto usage, SSRF, and dependency hygiene, layered on the ruff/ty quality gate. Use when writing or editing Python, and especially for changes touching user input, subprocess/OS calls, SQL or other query construction, templating, cryptography, secrets/credentials, or access control.

# python-secure-coding

## Purpose

Produce Python code that passes the repository's `ruff` and `ty` checks cleanly, and that
additionally follows Python security best practices no linter fully verifies on its own. This
skill is a triage layer: it routes the change to the security detail that applies to it, then
holds the change to a bounded verify loop. The per-category detail lives in `references/`, read on
demand rather than up front.

## When to use this

- Authoring or modifying Python source in a repository that adopts these instructions.
- Any change that touches user input, deserialization, subprocess/OS/shell calls, SQL or other
  query construction, templating, cryptography, passwords, secrets/credentials, server-side HTTP
  requests to user-influenced destinations, or access control.

## When NOT to use this

- Non-Python changes.

## Steps

1. Read the tooling baseline in `instructions/python_coding_instructions.md` (see below) and follow
   it. It is the single source of truth for the `ruff`/`ty` workflow and for the judgment items no
   tool checks.
2. Identify which change types in the triage table below the change matches, and read those
   reference files. Read only what applies; the table is the index, not a reading list.
3. Write or modify the code, applying that guidance.
4. Run the verify loop below until it is clean or the bound is reached.
5. State the security reasoning for any non-obvious call in the commit message or PR description.

## Tooling baseline

The `ruff`/`ty` baseline is defined in `instructions/python_coding_instructions.md`. Read that file
rather than relying on a summary. In short:

- Run the tools through the repository's package manager (`uv run ruff check`, `uv run ty check`).
- Run `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, and `ty check` yourself. Do not merely describe them.
- Do not weaken configuration or add a suppression as a first response to a failing check.
- The instructions file also lists the judgment items no tool checks (docstring accuracy, domain
  naming, security rationale, boundary-only validation, batching, suppression justification).
  Apply them; they are not repeated here.

Two points matter specifically for security:

- **Lint configuration.** Leave an existing ruff or lint configuration alone, per the rule in the
  instructions file. `select = ["ALL"]` is something to propose for a new project, or when the
  user asks for stricter linting, not something to impose on a repository that has already chosen
  its rules. A full rule set is what pulls in `S` (flake8-bandit), `BLE`, `TRY`, `ASYNC`, and
  `PERF`, so where it is absent, expect thinner security lint coverage and lean harder on the
  references below.
- **`S`-rule suppressions.** Never disable an `S` (bandit) rule repository-wide to silence one
  instance. Suppress narrowly at the call site, with a one-line justification.

## Triage: which reference to read

Ruff's `S` rules catch many insecure patterns syntactically, but cannot trace data flow, judge
trust boundaries, or check runtime configuration. Treat an `S`-rule pass as a floor, not proof of
security. Match the change against this table and read the files that apply:

| The change touches | Read |
|---|---|
| User input, request parameters, uploaded or scraped data | [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| SQL or other query construction, ORM raw queries | [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| `subprocess`, `os.system`, shell strings, `eval`/`exec` | [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| HTML templating or any rendered output | [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| Regular expressions applied to untrusted input | [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| `pickle`, `marshal`, `shelve`, `yaml.load`, XML parsing | [references/deserialization.md](references/deserialization.md) |
| Secrets, API keys, tokens, credentials, `.env` handling | [references/secrets.md](references/secrets.md) |
| Password hashing, token generation, randomness, token comparison | [references/secrets.md](references/secrets.md) |
| Logging of anything user-controlled or sensitive | [references/secrets.md](references/secrets.md) and [references/injection.md](references/injection.md) |
| Writing captured output, transcripts, snapshots, or generated docs into the repository | [references/secrets.md](references/secrets.md) |
| Encryption, signing, TLS settings, certificate verification | [references/crypto-tls.md](references/crypto-tls.md) |
| Authentication, authorization, permissions, file modes, DB grants | [references/access-control.md](references/access-control.md) |
| Server-side HTTP requests to user-influenced URLs or hosts (SSRF) | [references/access-control.md](references/access-control.md) |
| `except` around an auth or crypto check, `assert` as a guard, debug config | [references/access-control.md](references/access-control.md) |
| Temp files, locking, shared mutable state (TOCTOU) | [references/access-control.md](references/access-control.md) |
| Adding, upgrading, or pinning a dependency | [references/supply-chain.md](references/supply-chain.md) |

If the change matches nothing in the table, the tooling baseline and the verification checklist
still apply.

## Verify

Never declare a change done from the edit alone. Run every check through the repository's package
manager rather than as a bare binary, so it uses the pinned versions:

- `uv run ruff check .`, with no new ignores.
- `uv run ruff format --check .`.
- `uv run ty check`, with no new suppressions.
- The repository's dependency vulnerability scanner, if one is configured, when dependencies
  changed.

### The bounded loop

One **attempt** is one full fix-and-rerun cycle: apply fixes for the findings from the previous
run, then rerun every check above to completion. Reading output, or re-reading a file without
changing anything, is not an attempt.

- Baseline the loop at 3 attempts.
- Continue past 3 only while making measurable progress, meaning each cycle ends with strictly
  fewer findings than the one before it.
- Stop early, before 3 attempts, if the loop is oscillating: the same findings recur, the count
  stops dropping, or a fix for one finding reintroduces another.
- When stopping for either reason, report to the user rather than proceeding or silently giving
  up. Name the failing check, include its output, and state what was tried.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Verify loop run to a clean result, or stopped under the rules above with unresolved issues
      reported, naming the failing check and its output
- [ ] `uv run ruff check .` clean
- [ ] `uv run ruff format --check .` clean
- [ ] `uv run ty check` clean
- [ ] No new or weakened lint or type-check suppressions without a one-line justification, and no
      repository-wide `S`-rule disabling
- [ ] Untrusted input (user input, network/API responses, files) is validated/sanitized at the
      boundary, not assumed safe downstream, with ReDoS-prone regexes avoided
- [ ] No untrusted data reaches `eval`/`exec`, `subprocess`/`os.system` with `shell=True`,
      `pickle`/`yaml.load`, or string-built SQL
- [ ] Server-side requests to user-influenced URLs/hosts are validated against an allowlist (SSRF)
- [ ] Secrets/credentials traced end-to-end: not hardcoded, not logged, not in tracebacks or
      responses; secret/token comparisons use `secrets.compare_digest`/`hmac.compare_digest`
- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt/Argon2; security-sensitive randomness uses `secrets`, not
      `random`
- [ ] Authorization enforced server-side; security checks fail closed; debug mode off in
      production config
- [ ] Dependency changes checked against the repository's existing vulnerability scanner (if any)
- [ ] Nothing committed carries user or system information: no home-directory paths, usernames,
      uids, hostnames, internal IPs, or real email addresses in code, captured output, fixtures,
      snapshots, or generated docs
- [ ] Every reference file matched in the triage table was read and applied
